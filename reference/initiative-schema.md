## Initiative Schema

Initiatives are structural parents — strategic containers that hold multiple related ideas under a unifying narrative. They are distinct from ideas: initiatives frame the strategic argument, ideas are the discrete proposals within it.

**Examples:**
- "Authentic Assessment for BTS '27" holds 8 child ideas (grading, rubric design, scalability, etc.)
- "Platform AI Intelligence Layer" holds ideas for intelligence models that compose into shared infrastructure

### Initiative Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: incubator/initiative
stage: seed | developing | drafting | refining | complete
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD

# Classification
domain: assessments | platform | cross-product
themes: []  # Categorization tags, same as ideas

# Initiative-Specific
organizing-question: null  # The central strategic question this initiative answers
strategic-narrative: null  # 2-3 sentences on why these ideas cluster together
child-ideas: []  # Authoritative list of child idea filenames (without path or .md)

# Tracking
source: inbox | slack | conversation | meeting
output-file: null  # Path to initiative-level output document, if one is produced
research: []
blocked_by: null
---
```

**What initiatives do NOT have:** Impact dimensions (`customer-sentiment`, `user-experience`, etc.). Those belong on child ideas. An initiative's strategic value is emergent from its children.

### Child-to-Parent Reference

Child ideas reference their parent via a frontmatter field:

```yaml
initiative: authentic-assessment-bts27  # Initiative filename without .md
```

The initiative card maintains the authoritative `child-ideas:` list. One parent per idea.

### Initiative Stage Model

Initiatives follow the same stage names but with different semantics:

| Stage | Meaning for Initiatives |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Seed** | Framing exists — organizing question, narrative, children identified. Children may still be seeds. |
| **Developing** | Children actively developing. Initiative narrative enriched as research reveals patterns across children. |
| **Drafting** | Decision made: does this initiative produce its own synthesis output doc? If yes, drafting begins. |
| **Refining** | Initiative output doc being refined. |
| **Complete** | Initiative output finalized, or children have shipped individual outputs and the initiative served its organizing purpose. |

### Output Format Heuristic

Initiatives are probable candidates for **strategy docs** — they frame a strategic argument across multiple proposals. Child ideas are probable candidates for **product briefs** — they're discrete, scoped proposals with specific deliverables. This isn't a hard rule (a child idea with broad strategic implications might warrant a strategy doc), but it's the default expectation when choosing output format at the Stage 2→3 gate.

### Initiative File Naming

Same convention as ideas: kebab-case, no special suffix. Distinguished by `type: incubator/initiative` in frontmatter.

### Initiative Body Template

```markdown
## [Initiative Title]

**Organizing question:** [The central strategic question]
**Strategic narrative:** [2-3 sentences — why these ideas compose into something larger than any single one]

### Child Ideas
- [child-idea-1] — [one-line summary of its role in the initiative]
- [child-idea-2] — [one-line summary]
- ...

### Original Capture
[Verbatim original capture if the initiative originated from inbox]
