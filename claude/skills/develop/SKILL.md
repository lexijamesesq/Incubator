# /develop — Seed Development Session (Stage 1→2)

Transforms a seed-stage idea into a researched, assessed TL;DR nugget. Researches strategic context, market intelligence, and related ideas, then delegates strategic synthesis to the develop-synthesis agent running in an isolated context optimized for judgment-heavy work.

## Invocation

```
/develop [idea-name]
```

- Required argument: the name of a seed-stage idea file in `Ideas/`
- If no argument provided: list available seed-stage ideas and ask the user to pick
- Examples: `/develop foraging-intelligence`, `/develop cache-optimization`

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to resolve the target idea file.

**Resolution rules:**

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Empty | List all seed-stage ideas in Ideas/, ask user to select |
| `idea-name` | Resolve to `Ideas/{idea-name}.md` |
| `idea-name.md` | Strip `.md`, resolve as above |

**Fuzzy matching:** If exact match fails, list all `.md` files in Ideas/ and find filenames containing the argument as a substring (case-insensitive). If exactly one match, use it. If multiple matches, present options and ask user to pick. If zero matches, report and exit.

## Role

You are the orchestrator for the /develop pipeline. You handle research, human interaction, and coordination. Strategic synthesis is delegated to the develop-synthesis agent, which runs in an isolated context with a clean window optimized for judgment-heavy work.

You are working on behalf of the role specified in CLAUDE.md (Configuration > Role). Your output serves two audiences:
- **Internal:** The user uses TL;DR nuggets to prioritize which ideas to develop further
- **External:** TL;DR nuggets may be pushed to JPD for stakeholder visibility via /jpd-push

## Execution Flow

Execute these steps in order. Stop and report errors at any step rather than continuing with bad data.

### Step 0: Parse Arguments

1. Read `$ARGUMENTS`
2. If empty: use `Glob` to list all `.md` files in `Ideas/`. Read each file until the first `###` heading or 40 lines (whichever comes first) to check frontmatter for `stage: seed`. Present seed-stage ideas to the user and ask them to select one. If no seed-stage ideas exist, report "No seed-stage ideas found in Ideas/" and exit.
3. If provided: attempt to resolve `Ideas/{argument}.md`
   - Try exact match first (with and without `.md` extension)
   - If not found, try fuzzy substring match against all filenames in Ideas/
   - If exactly one fuzzy match, use it
   - If multiple fuzzy matches, present options and ask user to pick
   - If zero matches, report "Idea file not found: {argument}. Available files in Ideas/: {list}" and exit

### Step 1: Load Context

Load these files in parallel:

1. **Seed file** at the resolved path — full content
2. **Persona guide** — `persona.md`
3. **OKRs** — Read the OKRs document (path configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References > `strategic_context.okrs`)
4. **Idea index** — Use `Glob` to list all `.md` files in `Ideas/`, then apply tiered reading:
   - **Complete-stage ideas:** Read frontmatter only (first 25 lines or until `---` closes). Extract: stage, themes, domain. These provide theme vocabulary only — complete ideas are excluded from Step 3 matching.
   - **All other ideas (seed, developing, drafting, refining):** Read until first `###` heading or 40 lines. Extract: frontmatter + header fields (Core insight, Problem, Who cares, Strategic connection). Used for Step 3 matching AND portfolio context in the synthesis handoff.
   From the loaded index, extract all unique `themes` values across all idea files into a **portfolio theme vocabulary** — the canonical set of themes in use. Used in Step 5e to ensure theme reuse.
5. **Shared research baseline** — Query the strategy research database for structured competitive intelligence, customer evidence, and market sizing relevant to this idea's capabilities:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/research-db.py lookup-capabilities --json '{}'
   python3 scripts/research-db.py query-landscape --json '{"capabilities": ["slug-1", "slug-2"]}'
   python3 scripts/research-db.py query-gaps --json '{"capabilities": ["slug-1", "slug-2"]}'
   ```
   Derive capability slugs from the seed's `themes` and `core insight` using the vocabulary list — themes may map directly or expand (e.g., `ai-capabilities` → `ai-item-generation`, `ai-open-response-scoring`). Entries within TTL are baseline; entries past TTL are directional only and require reverification during Stream A/B research. Gap detection identifies where enrichment agents should focus live web research.

6. **Competitor registry** — Snowflake `competitors` table. Already covered by Step 5's `query-landscape` call (returns name, category, market_tier, pricing_model, matched capabilities filtered by the seed's capability slugs). For competitors central to the seed's competitive frame, follow up with `query-competitor` for the full intelligence body and linked findings.

### Step 2: Validate the Seed

Confirm the seed file has:
- `stage: seed` in frontmatter
- Core insight populated in body (non-empty)
- Source populated in body (non-empty)
- Initial strategic connection populated in body (non-empty)
- `domain` set in frontmatter
- `themes` with at least one entry in frontmatter

**If any required field is missing:** Report exactly which fields are missing and exit. Do not proceed with incomplete seeds.

**If `stage` is not `seed`:** Report "Idea '{name}' is at stage '{current-stage}', not 'seed'. This skill only develops seed-stage ideas." and exit.

### Step 3: Verify Seed Refinement

**Prerequisite:** Seeds should be refined via `/refine-seed` before development. Refinement handles intent clarification (capability-absent vs. experience-broken), header field drafting, related ideas matching, and merge/keep decisions.

Check the seed file for refinement indicators:
- **Core insight** populated (non-empty, one sentence)
- **Initial strategic connection** populated (names a priority and mechanism)
- **related-ideas** frontmatter resolved (may be empty if no relations exist — that's valid)

**If header fields are missing or empty:** Report: "Seed '{name}' appears unrefined — Core insight and/or Strategic connection missing. Run `/refine-seed {name}` first to clarify intent and position in the portfolio, then re-run /develop." Exit.

**If header fields are present:** Proceed. The seed has been through intent refinement and is ready for research.

### Step 4: Research

Conduct five research streams. Streams B-E invoke specialized agents; Stream A is orchestrator-executed. Prioritize depth over breadth — 3 strong findings beat 10 shallow ones.

**Phase 1: Agent Research (sequential — platform constraint)**

Invoke these five skills in order. Each runs in a forked context, produces a research artifact at `Research/{idea-name}/`, and may write qualifying findings to shared research files. No agent depends on another's output.

1. **`/divergent-thinking {idea-name}`** (Stream E: Divergent Discovery)
   Produces structural analogies and identifies "the disruptive one." Reads ONLY the idea file — deliberately context-starved. Fastest agent (no web searches). Produces `Research/{idea-name}/divergent-angles.md`.

2. **`/educator-sme {idea-name}`** (Stream D: Educator Perspective)
   Evaluates adoption realism, pain point validity, classroom barriers, skeptic/champion scenarios. Queries the research database for customer evidence as baseline. May write qualifying findings to the database. Produces `Research/{idea-name}/educator-evaluation.md`.

3. **`/edtech-sme {idea-name}`** (Stream B: Market Intelligence — Competitive)
   Competitive positioning, market fit, technology risk, go-to-market, strategic timing. Queries the research database for competitive landscape as baseline. Writes qualifying findings to the database. Produces `Research/{idea-name}/edtech-market-analysis.md`.

4. **`/tam-estimate {idea-name}`** (Stream B: Market Intelligence — Sizing)
   TAM/SAM/SOM with top-down/bottom-up reconciliation and sensitivity analysis. Queries the research database for market-sizing findings as baseline. Writes qualifying findings to the database. Produces `Research/{idea-name}/tam-estimate.md`.

5. **`/cross-domain {idea-name}`** (Stream C: Cross-Domain Discovery)
   Queries JPD for ideas from other product domains with functional overlap. Classifies signals as Direct overlap, Enabler/dependency, or Convergence. Writes `Research/{idea-name}/cross-domain-signals.md`.

**Agent failure handling:** If any agent fails (timeout, stop rule, error), note the failure reason and continue to the next agent. No single agent blocks the pipeline. See error handling table for per-agent fallback behavior.

**Phase 2: Refresh Shared Research Baseline**

After all agents complete, re-query the research database to pick up any findings or competitor entries agents wrote during Phase 1:
- `python3 scripts/research-db.py query-landscape --json '{"capabilities": ["slug-1", "slug-2"]}'` — refreshed findings + competitor metadata

Agents may have called `upsert-competitor` for new/updated competitors and `write-findings` for new findings. This refresh ensures Phase 3 works from the latest state.

**Phase 3: Stream A — Internal Strategic Context (orchestrator)**

No agent covers this — strategy docs, NPS, and OKRs require internal file access.

- Grep the product strategy document (path configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References > `strategic_context.product_strategy`) for the seed's theme keywords and domain terms. Extract relevant passages. Never load the full file.
- Scan the seed file's `### Original Capture` section for strategic signals, connections, or context that didn't make it into the seed's structured fields. Raw captures often contain intuitive connections and half-formed insights that inform research direction.
- Grep the design strategy document (path configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References > `strategic_context.design_strategy`) for relevant design priorities.
- Reference the OKRs loaded in Step 1 — identify which 2026 goals this idea would advance.
- **NPS customer signal check (two-phase):** For the relevant product(s), scan NPS analysis files in the directories configured under `metrics.nps_product_a` and `metrics.nps_product_b`. Cap the scan to files from the past 12 months.

  **Phase 1 — Longitudinal keyword scan (all months within 12-month window):**
  Derive 3-5 search terms from the seed's themes, core insight, and domain terms. Grep ALL `.md` files in each NPS directory for those terms. Record which files (months) contain matches and which do not. If zero files match across all months for a product, record: "Zero mentions of {topic} across {N} months of {product} NPS data ({date range})" — this distinguishes latent demand (observable in behavior, not voiced in feedback) from articulated demand, and directly informs the Customer Sentiment dimension.

  **Phase 2 — Targeted section reads:**
  - **Always:** Read the **Top Pain Points** and **The Signal** sections from the **3 most recent** files per product (6 files total). These sections are small (~10-16 lines each) — use the Read tool with offset/limit to target them directly rather than grepping then conditionally reading.
  - **If Phase 1 matched older files:** Also read **Top Pain Points**, **The Signal**, and **3 Things That Matter** from each matched file for verbatim quotes and trend context.
  - Do not read Summary, What's Working, or Document Links sections. Do not read raw CSV data or full analysis files.

  NPS findings directly inform the Customer Sentiment dimension rating. Absence of signal across the full window is itself evidence — note it explicitly in the handoff.
- **Shared research check:** Review the refreshed database query results for findings relevant to this idea's problem space. Note which entries are within TTL (usable as baseline) versus past TTL (directional only — reverify). This now includes any findings agents wrote during Phase 1.
- For each finding, note connection strength: **direct** (explicitly named), **adjacent** (related priority, plausible mechanism), or **indirect** (thematic only).
- **Database enrichment:** When specific competitors surface during Stream A research, use the database for targeted deep-dives:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/research-db.py query-competitor --json '{"name": "Competitor Name"}'
  ```
  This retrieves the full profile (intelligence body, all findings, capability tags) for that specific competitor — richer context than the local file frontmatter alone. Use selectively for competitors that are central to the idea's competitive positioning, not for every competitor in the registry.

**Phase 4: Stream B Fallback (orchestrator — only if edtech-sme failed)**

If `/edtech-sme` failed in Phase 1, execute fallback market intelligence research:
- Use `WebSearch` for competitor landscape, market trends, technology enablers, and customer signals.
- Execute 3-5 targeted searches derived from the seed's themes and core insight.
- Capture findings with source URLs.
- Target: named competitors, specific capabilities, technology shifts.

This preserves current Stream B quality when the agent is unavailable. If edtech-sme succeeded, skip this phase entirely — the agent's output is the market intelligence.

**Phase 5: Read Agent Artifacts**

Read all successfully produced agent artifacts to prepare for handoff creation:
- `Research/{idea-name}/edtech-market-analysis.md` (if edtech-sme succeeded)
- `Research/{idea-name}/tam-estimate.md` (if tam-estimate succeeded)
- `Research/{idea-name}/educator-evaluation.md` (if educator-sme succeeded)
- `Research/{idea-name}/divergent-angles.md` (if divergent-thinking succeeded)
- `Research/{idea-name}/cross-domain-signals.md` (if cross-domain succeeded)

Extract key findings from each for the handoff. For agent artifacts, preserve specificity — copy key sections verbatim (competitor tables, TAM summary tables, adoption assessments) rather than summarizing. The synthesis agent depends on this specificity.

**Exception: cross-domain.** The synthesis agent does not use cross-domain data — it goes directly to the card as a post-synthesis section (Step 5b). Include only the status line (succeeded/failed + signal count) in the handoff, not the full signal list.

### Step 4.5: Create Synthesis Handoff

After all research phases complete, create the handoff artifact at `Research/{idea-name}/synthesis-handoff.md`. Create the directory if it does not exist.

This artifact is the curated research input for the synthesis agent. Preserve specific data points, named capabilities, URLs, issue keys, and connection strengths — the synthesis agent depends on this specificity. For agent-produced sections, extract key sections verbatim from the artifacts rather than summarizing. For shared research entries, include the specific URL from each entry's `Source:` field — the synthesis agent uses these URLs for Research Summary citations and cannot guess them.

```markdown
# Research Handoff: {idea-name}

**Date:** {today}
**Idea:** {title from seed}
**Seed core insight:** {from seed body}
**Seed strategic connection:** {from seed body}

---

## Strategic Context (Stream A)

### Product Strategy — {connection strength}
- {Finding with connection strength noted}
- {Finding with connection strength noted}

### Design Strategy — {connection strength}
- {Finding with specific design priority named}

### OKR Connections
- {OKR reference}: {how this idea advances it}

### NPS / Customer Evidence
- {Product} ({date range}): {key finding or "Zero mentions of {topic}"} ([{Product} NPS — {Month YYYY} tab]({external_url from CLAUDE.md > Configuration > metrics.nps_product_a or .nps_product_b}))
- **Key finding:** {synthesis of NPS evidence or absence}

Citation rule: each NPS bullet must end with a linked source pointing at the configured Google Doc URL for the product (`external_url` field under the matching `metrics.nps_product_*` config key in CLAUDE.md > Configuration > External References). Use the tab name (e.g., "March 2026 tab") in the link text so the reader knows which tab to navigate to. Local file paths under the configured `path` value MUST NOT appear in citations — they're internal scan locations, not viewable sources.

### Shared Research Baseline (within TTL)
- {Finding} ({confidence level}) ([Source Title](specific URL from entry's Source: field))
- {Finding} ({confidence level}) ([Source Title](specific URL from entry's Source: field))

---

## Market Intelligence (Stream B — EdTech SME)

{If edtech-sme succeeded: extract verbatim from edtech-market-analysis.md}
{If edtech-sme failed: populate from fallback web searches using the format below}

### Market Fit: {Strong/Moderate/Weak}
{One-sentence verdict + 2-4 sentences of supporting analysis}

### Competitive Positioning
| Competitor | Relevant Capability | Comparison |
|------------|---------------------|------------|
| {Name} | {What they do} | {Differentiation / Parity / Behind} |

Tag each competitor as `(registry)` or `(discovered)` to distinguish registry-sourced from organically-discovered competitors. This traceability supports eval criteria and registry maintenance.

**Positioning narrative:** {2-3 sentences}

### Technology Risk: {Low/Medium/High}
{2-3 sentences on maturity, integration requirements, build/buy considerations}

### Strategic Timing
{2-3 sentences on market window, urgency signals}

{If edtech-sme failed, note: "Market intelligence from fallback web searches — EdTech SME unavailable: {reason}"}

---

## Market Sizing (Stream B — TAM Estimate)

{If tam-estimate succeeded: extract from tam-estimate.md}
{If tam-estimate failed: note absence}

### TAM / SAM / SOM
| Level | Moderate Estimate | Confidence |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| TAM | ${X} | {High/Med/Low} |
| SAM | ${X} | {High/Med/Low} |
| SOM | ${X} | {High/Med/Low} |

### Key Assumptions
- {Assumption 1 with sensitivity impact}
- {Assumption 2 with sensitivity impact}

### Revenue-Potential Signal: {Low/Med/High}
{One sentence connecting TAM to the idea's revenue path}

{If tam-estimate failed: "Market sizing unavailable — {reason}. Revenue-potential dimension lacks quantitative evidence."}

---

## Educator Perspective (Stream D)

{If educator-sme succeeded: extract from educator-evaluation.md}
{If educator-sme failed: note absence}

### Adoption Assessment: {High/Medium/Low}
{One-sentence verdict}

### Pain Point Validity
{2-3 sentences on problem reality from educator daily experience}

### Adoption Barriers
{Specific friction points — concrete workflow realities}

### Champion Scenario
{One concrete scenario: role, context, what happens, outcome}

{If educator-sme failed: "Educator perspective unavailable — {reason}. Customer-sentiment and user-experience dimensions rely on NPS and shared research only."}

---

## Cross-Domain Discovery (Stream C)
{Succeeded — {N} signals | Failed — {reason}}

---

## Divergent Reframing (Stream E)

{If divergent-thinking succeeded: include the disruptive angle as a reframing candidate}
{If divergent-thinking failed: omit this section}

### The Disruptive Angle: {title}
{The connection — 2-3 sentences from the divergent-angles.md artifact}
{What it opens up — 1-2 sentences}

*This is a reframing candidate, not evidence. The synthesis agent decides whether it strengthens the strategic compound.*

---

## Research Synthesis

**Strategic connection:** {Strong/Medium/Weak}. {1-2 sentence summary of why.}

**Market validation:** {Strong/Medium/Weak}. {1-2 sentence summary. Reference edtech-sme market fit when available.}

**Customer evidence:** {Strong/Medium/Weak}. {1-2 sentence summary. Note latent vs. articulated demand. Reference educator-sme adoption assessment when available.}

**Competitive gap:** {Confirmed/Partial/Unconfirmed}. {1-2 sentence description. Reference edtech-sme competitive positioning when available.}

**Revenue signal:** {Strong/Medium/Weak}. {1-2 sentence summary. Reference tam-estimate when available.}

---

## Portfolio Context

### Related Ideas (header fields for differentiation)

{For each related idea identified in Step 3:}

**{idea-name}** ({stage})
- Core insight: {from their card}
- Problem: {from their card}
- Who cares: {from their card}
- Strategic connection: {from their card}
```

Populate from Step 4 research findings. Sections with no findings should note the absence explicitly (e.g., "Zero mentions of {topic} in NPS data" or "Cross-domain discovery unavailable — MCP timeout"). Agent sections that failed should include the failure note per the template above.

### Step 5: Strategic Synthesis

Invoke the synthesis agent to produce the TL;DR card content.

**Invoke via Skill tool:**
Use the Skill tool with skill name `develop-synthesis`, passing the idea name as the argument.

The develop-synthesis skill runs in an isolated agent context with a clean window. It reads the seed file, the synthesis handoff (created in Step 4.5), the persona guide, the format example, and related ideas context. It produces the completed TL;DR card — frontmatter updates (stage, dimensions) and body content (header fields, opportunity assessment, research summary, thought outline, open questions).

After the agent returns, read the updated idea file to confirm synthesis completed (stage changed to `developing`, impact dimensions populated).

If the agent reports insufficient research or a stop condition, surface it to the user and halt.

### Step 5b: Cross-Domain Signals Section

If /cross-domain succeeded, write a `### Cross-Domain Signals` section to the card after the Research Summary section. The content comes from the /cross-domain skill's Phase 3 formatted output (already in the orchestrator's context from Phase 1 agent invocation) — transfer it directly, no reformatting needed (Phase 3 output uses the card section format).

If the Phase 3 output is no longer in context, re-read the artifact at `Research/{idea-name}/cross-domain-signals.md` and apply the same curation the skill applies in Phase 3: include convergence group members, direct overlap items, and enablers that are specifically load-bearing for this idea's core capability. Maximum 5 signals. Write using the card section format:

```markdown
### Cross-Domain Signals
{N} ideas from other domains with possible functional overlap:
- [{issue-key}]({url}) {summary} ({Domain Label}) — {Signal type}: {Connection sentence}
```

Issue keys are linked using the Atlassian base URL from the artifact. Include convergence group descriptions after the signal list only when they add insight beyond what the individual entries state — a cross-cutting pattern or strategic implication that emerges from the combination.

If /cross-domain failed, omit the section entirely.

### Step 5c: Buildable Surface Check

After synthesis completes, invoke the buildable surface enrichment agent to check whether the Thought Outline is principle-shaped or feature-shaped.

**Invoke via Skill tool:**
Use the Skill tool with skill name `buildable-surface`, passing the idea name as the argument (e.g., `foraging-intelligence`).

The buildable-surface skill runs in an isolated agent context. It reads the idea card and research artifacts, applies a three-signal detection heuristic, and either:
- **No-ops** (feature-shaped) — no section added, proceed to Step 6
- **Fires** (principle-shaped or borderline) — writes a `### Buildable Surface` section between Thought Outline and Open Questions

Either way, proceed to Step 5d. If the skill reports an error (e.g., research too thin for grounded candidates), note it in the Step 9 presentation and proceed.

### Step 5d: Disruptive Reframing Section

If `/divergent-thinking` succeeded, write a `### Disruptive Reframing` section to the card between Thought Outline and Buildable Surface (or between Thought Outline and Open Questions if Buildable Surface did not fire). The content is a 2-3 sentence distillation of the disruptive angle from `Research/{idea-name}/divergent-angles.md`.

Read the artifact and locate "## The Disruptive One" — the divergent-thinking skill identifies one of its 3-5 angles as the disruptive frame. Distill from that angle's "The connection" and "What it opens up" content. Stay close to the artifact's language; do not generatively rewrite. Use the format:

```markdown
### Disruptive Reframing
**{Disruptive Angle Title}** — {2-3 sentence insight summarizing the connection and what it opens up}
```

This section is card-canonical — `/jpd-push` Step 3b reads it from the card first, with self-heal fallback to the artifact if missing. The card content must match exactly what gets pushed to JPD; do not add additional paragraphs, links, or commentary that would not also appear in JPD.

If `/divergent-thinking` failed or no `divergent-angles.md` exists, omit the section entirely.

### Step 5e: Theme Management

Using the portfolio theme vocabulary collected in Step 1 and the research findings from Step 4, assess whether the seed's theme classifications still hold.

**General theme assessment:**
- For each existing theme: does research confirm this idea is substantively about this theme, or was it a surface-signal classification? Remove if incidental.
- For themes in the portfolio vocabulary NOT on the seed: did research reveal a genuine connection the router missed? Add if substantive. Only use existing themes — never invent new ones.
- Minimum one theme per idea.

**ai-capabilities special case:**

Does AI make or break this idea?
- **Requires AI** → add the tag. The feature doesn't work without it.
- **Enhanced by AI** → add the tag. Works without AI, but AI is a natural progressive enhancement — not forced.
- **AI would be forced** → don't add. Solution looking for a problem.

Check the research before deciding — cross-domain signals, buildable surface candidates, and competitive landscape show what the market assumes about the mechanism. For cross-domain signals, re-read the artifact at `Research/{idea-name}/cross-domain-signals.md` if the Phase 1 output is no longer in context — the synthesis handoff does not carry cross-domain detail.

**Record all changes** (additions/removals with one-sentence rationale each) for Step 9 presentation.

### Step 5f: Title Revision

Assessment question: "If someone reads only this title and the Core insight sentence, do they get an accurate picture of what this idea is?"

**Revise when:** research shifted the idea's center of gravity, the router title reflects raw capture framing rather than developed understanding, or the title is too generic to distinguish from other portfolio ideas.

**Keep when:** title is still accurate and specific after research.

**Constraint:** Filename stays stable — it's the identifier across related-ideas, research folders, and jira-key. Only the `## [Heading]` in the body changes.

**Record** before/after for Step 9 presentation.

### Step 6: Critic Review

After writing the card to file, invoke the artifact critic to check structural and voice conformance. This runs in a forked, isolated context to avoid same-pass confirmation bias.

**Invoke via Skill tool:**
Use the Skill tool with skill name `artifact-critic`, passing the completed idea card file path as the argument (e.g., `Ideas/foraging-intelligence.md`).

The artifact-critic skill runs in the artifact-critic agent's isolated context — separate from this session — with read access to vault notes via Obsidian MCP. It returns a deviation report.

**Triage the findings:**
For each finding the critic returns, either:
- **Fix it** in the idea file, or
- **Override it** with a stated reason (the deviation is intentional and improves the artifact)

If any findings are overridden, note them in the Step 9 presentation under the confidence assessment so the human has visibility.

**Critic-skipped fallback:**
If the artifact-critic invocation returns an error, fails to produce a deviation report, or otherwise does not complete its check, do NOT silently proceed. The orchestrator must:
1. Note the failure reason in working memory.
2. Perform a best-effort self-review against the format spec and persona guide as a stopgap.
3. Explicitly surface in Step 9 under the confidence assessment: "Artifact-critic skipped — {reason}. Self-review only; independent adversarial check did not run."

The point of this skill is the independent check. A silent skip turns synthesis self-evaluation into the only quality gate, which is exactly the bias the critic exists to backstop. The human should always know whether the critic actually ran.

### Step 7: Self-Critique

After addressing critic findings, check the completed TL;DR against these criteria that require the full research context. Fix issues directly in the file:

1. **Multiplicative framing:** Does the Thought Outline show compounding value across dimensions? One move unlocking value in multiple directions simultaneously.
2. **Specificity:** Is the language precise? Names and mechanisms over abstractions. Specificity in the card means *precise language*, not *inline data* — N-values, survey sizes, and market figures belong in the research artifact.
3. **Strategic realism:** Are connections honest? Use "supports" not "advances" for indirect connections. Do not overstate alignment.
4. **Business language:** Would a VP understand without translation? No design methodology language.
5. **Completeness:** Every section has real content. No placeholders except Open Questions (which should have genuine unknowns).

Fix all issues directly in the file before proceeding.

**Human review awareness:** After presentation, the human evaluates using the Stage 2→3 review template (`Templates/review-templates.md`). That template focuses on: core framing accuracy, impact dimension credibility, strategic connection reality, output format readiness, and blocking unknowns. Anticipate these checks — if you know a dimension is shaky, say so in your confidence assessment rather than letting the human discover it.

### Step 8: Create Research Artifact and Verify Frontmatter

The synthesis handoff was created in Step 4.5. This step creates the full persistent research artifact and verifies all research paths are in frontmatter.

1. Create directory `Research/{idea-name}/` if it does not exist
2. Write `Research/{idea-name}/development-research.md` containing:
   - Search queries executed (both Grep patterns and WebSearch queries from Stream A and any fallback)
   - Agent invocation results (which succeeded, which failed, failure reasons)
   - Raw findings with sources (URLs, file paths)
   - Synthesis notes connecting findings to the idea
   - Date of research
   Both files persist — `synthesis-handoff.md` is the curated input to the synthesis agent, `development-research.md` is the full research trail for downstream stages.
3. **Frontmatter verification:** Read the idea file's `research:` array. Each agent that succeeded should have already appended its artifact path during its run. Verify all expected paths are present and add any that are missing:
   - `Research/{idea-name}/synthesis-handoff.md` (orchestrator — always)
   - `Research/{idea-name}/development-research.md` (orchestrator — always)
   - `Research/{idea-name}/edtech-market-analysis.md` (if edtech-sme succeeded)
   - `Research/{idea-name}/tam-estimate.md` (if tam-estimate succeeded)
   - `Research/{idea-name}/educator-evaluation.md` (if educator-sme succeeded)
   - `Research/{idea-name}/divergent-angles.md` (if divergent-thinking succeeded)
   - `Research/{idea-name}/cross-domain-signals.md` (if cross-domain succeeded)

### Step 9: Present for Review

Present the completed development to the user with:

```
Development complete: {idea-name}

**Research summary:**
- Stream A (Internal): {N} strategic connections found ({direct/adjacent/indirect breakdown})
- Stream B (EdTech SME): {succeeded — market fit {verdict}, {N} competitors positioned | failed — fallback web searches used}
- Stream B (TAM): {succeeded — TAM ${X} moderate, confidence {level} | failed — market sizing unavailable}
- Stream C (Cross-domain): {N signals | unavailable — {reason}}
- Stream D (Educator): {succeeded — adoption {verdict} | failed — {reason}}
- Stream E (Divergent): {succeeded — disruptive angle: {title} | failed — {reason}}

**Related seeds:** {list or "none found"}

**Classification updates:**
- Title: {unchanged | "Old Title" → "New Title"}
- Themes: {unchanged | added: [x, y], removed: [z] — rationale per change}
- AI Feature (JPD): {Yes — AI is load-bearing | No — core value stands without AI}

**Confidence level:** {High/Medium/Low}
- High: Strong strategic connection + market validation + clear impact path
- Medium: Decent strategic connection but gaps in market data or impact clarity
- Low: Weak connections, thin research, or significant open questions

**Completed TL;DR:**
{Show the full updated file content}

**Recommended next steps:**
- {Contextual recommendations based on confidence level and findings}
- {e.g., "Share TL;DR with leadership for strategic alignment feedback" or "Research gap: need customer data before impact dimensions are credible"}

**Output format recommendation:**
Based on the idea's nature, recommend one of:
- **strategy-doc** — if the idea is a positioning play, narrative framing, multi-product strategic direction, or capability that shapes how multiple products evolve
- **product-brief** — if the idea is a scoped product initiative with specific features, JTBD, timeline dependencies, and a defined deliverable

Present the recommendation with rationale: which signals does this idea exhibit? This is a recommendation — the human decides. The skill does NOT set `output-file` in frontmatter.
```

**Database write-back:**

After presenting the TL;DR, review all findings from this development session against the shared research capture heuristic (Sourced + Durable + Decision-relevant + Shared). Write qualifying findings to the strategy research database so future runs benefit from structured, queryable intelligence:

```bash
python3 scripts/research-db.py write-findings --json '{
  "findings": [
    {
      "claim": "...",
      "evidence": "...",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "source_url": "https://specific-page-url (REQUIRED — not a homepage)",
      "source_description": "fallback only when no stable URL exists",
      "ttl_months": 12,
      "topic": "competitive-landscape|customer-evidence|market-sizing|enrichment",
      "category": "capability-specific|capability-presence|competitive-gap|...",
      "capabilities": ["slug-1", "slug-2"],
      "competitor_id": "uuid-or-null"
    }
  ]
}'
```

**Source URL requirement:** Every finding written to the database MUST have a `source_url` with the most specific available page (press release, feature page, research report) — not a homepage. If no stable URL exists, use `source_description` with enough detail to locate the source (publication name, date, title). Do not write findings with neither. This is the same standard applied to shared research file entries.

Use `python3 scripts/research-db.py lookup-competitor --json '{"name": "..."}'` to resolve competitor names to IDs. Prioritize findings that close gaps identified in Step 1 database queries.

**Competitor registry updates:**

Update via `upsert-competitor` (Snowflake-backed). See the edtech-sme skill for the full command schema. Summary:

- **New competitors:** Run `upsert-competitor` with full fields + evidence (`source_url` required). Fuzzy dup check returns candidates if a similar name exists — review and either pass `force_create: true` (new entity) or update the matched row instead.
- **Existing competitors:** Same command. Exact-name lookup hits the existing row; `last_researched` stamps automatically.
- **Category changes:** The command returns `action: needs_category_confirmation` rather than auto-applying. Surface the proposal to the human. Never pass `force_category_change: true` from a skill — that flag is human-only.
- **Found-superseded:** If the command returns `action: found_superseded`, surface to the human; never auto-revive.

Note in the presentation:
> **Competitor registry updated:**
> - New: {list with category and capabilities, or "none"}
> - Updated: {list with what changed, or "none"}
> - Category changes proposed: {list with rationale, or "none"}
> - Superseded entries surfaced: {list with name, or "none"}

## Stop Rules

At any point during execution, stop and report when:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Core insight already addressed by existing initiatives | Stop. Report what you found. Classify as "redirect" if initiative is in a different domain, "duplicate" if same domain. |
| No strategic connection can be established honestly | Stop. Report: no connection found after searching strategy docs and OKRs. Classify as "pause" (no foundation). |
| Critical context can only come from human | Stop. Report what's missing and why you cannot research it. Ask the human to provide. |
| Idea too vague to research meaningfully | Stop. Report: core insight too abstract for targeted research. Ask human to sharpen it. |
| Idea serves a domain outside the configured project domain (see CLAUDE.md > Configuration > Role) | Stop. Flag for rerouting to appropriate domain leader. Classify as "redirect". |
| Self-declared weakness in strategic connection | Treat as pre-filter signal. Validate quickly (one targeted Grep + one OKR check) before investing in full research. If validation fails, fire stop rule. |

**Minimum strategic connection threshold:** A viable connection requires at least one of:
- (a) Direct reference in product or design strategy docs
- (b) Direct advancement of a named 2026 OKR
- (c) Two or more adjacent connections to named priorities with a plausible mechanism

If none exist, the stop rule fires. When stopping, distinguish between:
- **Redirect:** Idea has merit but belongs in a different domain
- **Pause:** Idea lacks strategic foundation entirely

When stopping, state explicitly: what was found, what is missing, and what would unblock further development.

## Error Handling Summary

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| No argument and no seed-stage ideas exist | Report "No seed-stage ideas found in Ideas/" and exit |
| Idea file not found | Report with available filenames from Ideas/ listing, exit |
| Idea not at seed stage | Report current stage, exit |
| Missing required frontmatter fields | Report specific missing fields, exit |
| Missing required body sections (core insight, source, strategic connection) | Report specific missing sections, exit |
| Strategy doc Grep returns no results | Note "No matches found in {doc}" as a finding, continue to next stream |
| `/edtech-sme` fails (any reason) | Orchestrator falls back to 3-5 web searches for competitive landscape (current Stream B behavior). Note in handoff: "Market intelligence from fallback web searches — EdTech SME unavailable: {reason}." |
| `/tam-estimate` fails (any reason) | Note in handoff: "Market sizing unavailable — {reason}. Revenue-potential dimension lacks quantitative evidence." Continue. |
| `/educator-sme` fails (any reason) | Note in handoff: "Educator perspective unavailable — {reason}." Customer-sentiment and user-experience rely on NPS and shared research only. Continue. |
| `/divergent-thinking` fails (any reason) | Omit Divergent Reframing section from handoff. Continue. |
| `/cross-domain` fails (MCP auth/timeout) | Note "Cross-domain discovery unavailable — {reason}" in handoff. Continue. |
| All research streams empty (zero findings across all streams) | Fire stop rule — no strategic foundation. Report and exit. |
| Seed file has malformed frontmatter | Report parsing issue with specifics, exit |
| Related seed has malformed frontmatter | Log under "Index Issues", continue matching other seeds |
| Synthesis agent reports insufficient research | Surface the agent's assessment to the user, halt |
| Synthesis handoff creation fails | Report the error and halt |

## Scope Boundaries

This skill does NOT:
- Perform strategic synthesis — that is the develop-synthesis agent's job
- Refine seeds, clarify intent, or resolve related ideas — that is `/refine-seed`'s job (run it first)
- Create seed files (that is the router's job via `/process-inbox`)
- Decide output format — strategy doc vs. product brief (that is a human decision at Stage 2→3)
- Draft the full document (that is the `/draft` skill, Stage 2→3)
- Run the Sufficiency Evaluator (that is an MLP-phase agent)
- Process inbox items (that is `/process-inbox`)
- Merge or consolidate ideas (that is `/refine-seed`'s job)
- Load full strategy docs into context (Grep only — paths configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References > `strategic_context.product_strategy` and `strategic_context.design_strategy`)
- Invoke Gemini CLI (notes Atlassian references for manual lookup instead)
- Modify the idea file body after Stage 2 — the idea card is the permanent scannable artifact. /develop enriches it (Stage 1→2); subsequent stages create linked output documents.
