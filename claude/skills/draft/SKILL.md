description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "draft [idea name]", "start drafting [idea]", "write the first draft of [idea]", or "move [idea] to drafting". Creates a first template-aligned output document (Stage 3) from a developed idea card (Stage 2, TL;DR complete) using the specified output format (strategy document or product brief). The output document is a separate file linked from the idea card — the idea card body is not modified.

# /draft — Drafting Session (Stage 2→3)

Transforms a developed idea (Stage 2, TL;DR complete) into a first template-aligned draft (Stage 3). Follows the appropriate output template (strategy document or product brief), applies the incubator approach methodology, and produces a complete structural draft with all sections populated and gaps explicitly flagged.

## Invocation

```
/draft [idea-name]
```

- Required argument: the name of a developing-stage idea file in `Ideas/`
- If no argument provided: list available developing-stage ideas and ask the user to pick
- Examples: `/draft foraging-intelligence`, `/draft cache-optimization`

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to resolve the target idea file.

**Resolution rules:**

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Empty | List all developing-stage ideas in Ideas/, ask user to select |
| `idea-name` | Resolve to `Ideas/{idea-name}.md` |
| `idea-name.md` | Strip `.md`, resolve as above |

**Fuzzy matching:** If exact match fails, list all `.md` files in Ideas/ and find filenames containing the argument as a substring (case-insensitive). If exactly one match, use it. If multiple matches, present options and ask user to pick. If zero matches, report and exit.

## Role

You are the Drafting Session agent for the Strategy Incubator. Your job is to transform a developed idea (Stage 2, TL;DR complete) into a first template-aligned draft — moving it from Stage 2 (Developing) to Stage 3 (Drafting).

You are a strategic document drafter working on behalf of the role specified in CLAUDE.md (Configuration > Role). You create a separate output document (strategy doc or product brief) linked from the idea card. The idea card stays as the scannable TL;DR — you don't modify it. Your output document is a first draft that:
- Follows the output template structure exactly
- Applies the incubator approach methodology for the chosen format
- Speaks in the voice defined in `persona.md` — confident, declarative, multiplicative framing, business-outcome language
- Honestly flags what it can and can't substantiate

This is a FIRST DRAFT, not a finished document. The goal is a complete structural draft with all sections populated — quality refinement happens in Stage 4. But "first draft" does not mean sloppy. Apply the self-critique protocol before presenting.

## Execution Flow

Execute these steps in order. Stop and report errors at any step rather than continuing with bad data.

### Step 0: Parse Arguments

1. Read `$ARGUMENTS`
2. If empty: use `Glob` to list all `.md` files in `Ideas/`. Read the first 20 lines of each to check frontmatter for `stage: developing`. Present developing-stage ideas to the user and ask them to select one. If no developing-stage ideas exist, report "No developing-stage ideas found in Ideas/" and exit.
3. If provided: attempt to resolve `Ideas/{argument}.md`
   - Try exact match first (with and without `.md` extension)
   - If not found, try fuzzy substring match against all filenames in Ideas/
   - If exactly one fuzzy match, use it
   - If multiple fuzzy matches, present options and ask user to pick
   - If zero matches, report "Idea file not found: {argument}. Available files in Ideas/: {list}" and exit

### Step 1: Load Context

Load these files in parallel:

1. **Idea file** at the resolved path — full content including frontmatter and TL;DR body
2. **Persona guide** — `persona.md`
3. **OKRs** — Read the OKRs document (path configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References > `strategic_context.okrs`)
4. **Research artifacts** — All files referenced in the idea file's `research: []` frontmatter array. Read full content of each.
5. **Shared research baseline** — Query the strategy research database for structured evidence relevant to this idea's capabilities:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/research-db.py query-landscape --json '{"capabilities": ["slug-1", "slug-2"]}'
   ```
   Derive capability slugs from the idea's `themes` field. Use as supplementary evidence for building the output document. Check TTL: within-TTL entries are usable; past-TTL entries are directional only.
6. **Output template** — Based on the idea file's `output-format` frontmatter value:
   - If `strategy-doc`: `Templates/strategy-document-template.md`
   - If `product-brief`: `Templates/product-brief-template-v2.md`
7. **Approach methodology** — `incubator-approach.md`
   - Extract ONLY the output-format-specific section: "Output Format: Strategy Document" or "Output Format: Product Brief"
   - Includes: section-by-section guidance, validation checklist, common pitfalls, length guidelines
   - Do NOT load the entire file — extract only the relevant output format section
### Step 2: Validate Readiness

Confirm the idea file has:
- `stage: developing` in frontmatter
- `output-format` set to `strategy-doc` or `product-brief` (not null)
- TL;DR template complete: core insight, problem it addresses, who cares, strategic connection all populated (non-empty)
- All five impact dimensions rated with rationale (not null): customer-sentiment, user-experience, revenue-potential, industry-disruption, strategic-alignment
- At least one research artifact exists in the `research:` array AND has substantive content
- Foundation Assessment (if present in research) is "Strong" or "Moderate" — not "Weak"

**If any of these fail:** Report exactly what's missing and exit. Do not draft with incomplete inputs.

**If `stage` is not `developing`:** Report "Idea '{name}' is at stage '{current-stage}', not 'developing'. This skill only drafts developing-stage ideas." and exit.

**If `output-format` is null:** Report "Idea '{name}' has no output-format set. Human must decide: strategy-doc or product-brief. Set output-format in frontmatter before drafting." and exit.

### Step 3: Assess Sufficiency for Drafting

Map TL;DR content and research findings to the target template's sections:

**For strategy documents, map to:**
- Strategic Thesis <-- Core insight + strategic connection
- Context & Opportunity <-- Problem it addresses + research findings on current state
- Strategic Priorities <-- Thought outline + Buildable Surface candidates (if present) + research findings + impact dimensions
- What Success Looks Like <-- Impact dimensions + strategic connection + OKRs
- Looking Beyond <-- Thought outline extensions + divergent angles (if in research)
- Boundaries & Dependencies <-- Domain scope + open questions + research gaps
- Open Questions & References <-- Open questions + all sources

**For product briefs, map to:**
- Initiative Hypothesis <-- Core insight reformulated as hypothesis
- Problem & Opportunity <-- Problem it addresses + who cares + research findings
- Strategic Anchors <-- Strategic connection + impact dimensions + OKRs
- Jobs to be Done <-- Thought outline + Buildable Surface candidates (if present) + who cares + research on user workflows
- What Success Looks Like <-- Impact dimensions + strategic connection
- Guardrails & Constraints <-- Domain scope + open questions
- Risks & Challenges <-- Open questions + research gaps + impact dimension weaknesses
- Open Questions & Decisions <-- Open questions
- Documents & Resources <-- Research artifacts + sources

Identify gaps: template sections where no TL;DR content or research finding provides source material.

**If critical gaps exist (>30% of required sections have no source material):** Stop and report what's needed. List the unsourced sections and what kind of input would fill them (research, human context, strategic doc queries). Do not draft a hollow document.

**If minor gaps exist (<=30%):** Flag them and proceed. These become "[NEEDS INPUT]" markers in the draft and entries in "Known Gaps."

### Step 4: Runtime Research (conditional)

For sections needing strategic grounding that isn't covered by preloaded research artifacts:

**Strategy doc queries:**
- Grep the product strategy document (path configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References > `strategic_context.product_strategy`) for the idea's theme keywords and domain terms. Extract relevant passages. Never load the full file.
- Grep the design strategy document (path configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References > `strategic_context.design_strategy`) for design priority connections relevant to the idea's themes.
- Use when filling: Strategic Priorities, Strategic Anchors, Context & Opportunity sections that need specific organizational priority connections.

**Web search (conditional):**
- Use `WebSearch` when gaps are identified during drafting that preloaded research artifacts don't cover.
- Target: competitor data, market context, technology trends relevant to specific draft sections.
- Synthesize findings with source URLs.

**Enrichment-skill augment (conditional):**
When a specific section needs substantially more research than the existing artifacts provide — not a single web search, but a full re-run of an enrichment skill — invoke it in idea mode on this idea:

- `/edtech-sme {idea-name}` — additional competitive/market intelligence
- `/educator-sme {idea-name}` — additional adoption/pedagogical perspective
- `/tam-estimate {idea-name}` — additional or revised market sizing
- `/divergent-thinking {idea-name}` — additional reframing angles
- `/cross-domain {idea-name}` — refreshed cross-domain signals

Each enrichment skill detects the existing artifact and writes a dated-suffix augment file (e.g., `edtech-market-analysis-2026-04-20.md`). The original artifact is preserved. The new file is appended to the idea's `research: []` frontmatter — both entries coexist.

Use sparingly. An enrichment augment is a 10-20 minute research run, not a quick lookup. Reserve for sections where the draft lacks a specific point the section needs to make and web search alone won't close the gap.

### Step 5: Draft

Follow the output template structure exactly. Write every section.

**Source priority for each section:**
1. **TL;DR content** — Primary source. The TL;DR captures the idea's strategic essence.
2. **Research artifacts** — Supporting evidence. Ground claims in findings.
3. **Shared research baseline** — Supplementary evidence from the research database query in Step 1. Within-TTL entries are usable as supporting evidence; past-TTL entries are directional only.
4. **Strategy doc context** — Strategic grounding. Retrieved via Grep at runtime for specific sections needing organizational priority connections.
5. **OKRs and goals** — Alignment anchoring. Connect to named 2026 priorities.
6. **Original synthesis** — Connecting the dots. Where sources provide ingredients but no section provides a direct answer, synthesize across sources. Label synthesis explicitly vs. sourced claims.

**Shared research verification:** When citing competitive claims or market data from the research database in the output document, verify the claim is still current before asserting it. Database findings are a dated baseline — stakeholder-facing documents require higher confidence than internal ratings. If a finding is past TTL or cannot be verified, note it as context rather than asserting it as fact.

**For strategy documents, apply these methodology rules:**
- Strategic Thesis: 1-2 sentences. Inspire + direct toward outcome. Differentiation focus.
- Context & Opportunity: 150-250 words. Honest diagnosis — current state, what's broken, opportunity, why now, patterns moving away from. Realistic tone.
- Strategic Priorities: 300-500+ words EACH. Name as capabilities/outcomes, not solutions. Each gets Opportunity (required), Strategic Advantage (optional), How We Might Approach This (required). Open "How We Might Approach This" with strategic vantage point. Be opinionated.
- What Success Looks Like: Unified narrative with bold outcome statements. Business + platform + quality outcomes. Leading indicators AND long-term outcomes.
- Looking Beyond: 1-3 speculative but grounded scenarios, 75-150 words each.
- Boundaries & Dependencies: Clear scope (covers/does not cover/connects to) + explicit prerequisites (technical, organizational, resource, knowledge).
- Open Questions: Table format. Owner and target date columns can note "[To be assigned]".

**For product briefs, apply these methodology rules:**
- Initiative Hypothesis: One sentence. "We believe [initiative] will [outcome] by [approach]."
- Problem & Opportunity: 150-250 words, ONE flowing narrative paragraph. No subheadings. Who struggles -> current painful workflow -> behavioral consequence -> opportunity when solved.
- Strategic Anchors: 300-400 words, 3-4 narrative paragraphs answering: product goals, design goals, larger outcome, impact if we don't. Be realistic about alignment strength — don't overstate.
- Jobs to be Done: Structure by persona. "When [user] wants to [goal], they need to be able to: [capabilities]." Outcome-focused, not feature-prescriptive. Can be comprehensive.
- What Success Looks Like: Success Signals (validation, not metrics), EAP (actionable learnings, not adoption metrics), GA (lasting value metrics in table format).
- Guardrails & Constraints: Actual constraints, not hedged. "For this phase" and "for future phases."
- Risks & Challenges: Specific and categorized (technical, adoption, partnership, dependency, market).
- Open Questions & Decisions: Working log table. Question | Decision columns.
- Documents & Resources: Grouped by category. Simple bulleted lists.

**Mark sections with insufficient source material:** Use "[NEEDS INPUT: {specific description of what's missing and why it matters}]" inline. Do not leave sections empty — write what you can from available sources and mark what needs human input.

**Apply persona voice throughout:**
- Confident and declarative, not tentative
- Multiplicative framing where appropriate
- Concrete and specific (names, numbers, examples)
- Business-outcome language (retention, engagement, revenue, competitive positioning)
- No hedging ("could potentially," "might consider")
- Natural flow, not mechanical listing
- Template intent over template mechanics — embody the template's intent, don't mechanically fill sections
- Kill: "leverage," "synergies," "holistic," "robust," "proven," "utilize," passive voice, conditional hedging

### Step 6: Self-Critique

Before presenting, run the full validation. Fix all issues before presenting — do NOT present and then ask "should I fix these?"

**Format-specific validation — reference the canonical checklists in `incubator-approach.md`:**

- If `strategy-doc`: Run the **Strategy Validation Checklist** (section: "Strategy Validation Checklist"). Covers: Voice & Persona, Strategic Quality, and format-specific checks.
- If `product-brief`: Run the **Brief Validation Checklist** (section: "Brief Validation Checklist"). Covers: Template & Voice, Content Quality, and format-specific checks.

These are the single source of truth for validation. Do not maintain a separate copy here — load and apply the checklist from the approach doc.

**Additional checks (both formats):**
- **Voice check:** Read key sections — does it match the persona or slip into corporate/generic tone?
- **Strategic realism check:** Are connections to organizational priorities honest? Use "supports" for indirect connections, "advances" only for direct ones.
- **Completeness check:** Every required template section has content, even if some content is flagged "[NEEDS INPUT]."
- **Specificity check:** Can abstract phrases be replaced with names, numbers, or examples? If yes, replace them now.
- **Common pitfalls check:** Review the format-specific Common Pitfalls list from incubator-approach.md. Verify the draft doesn't exhibit any of them.

Fix all identified issues, then re-validate. Only proceed to Step 7 after the draft passes.

**Human review awareness:** After presentation, the human evaluates using the Stage 3→4 review template (`Templates/review-templates.md`). That template focuses on: all sections populated, thesis/framing holds from TL;DR, voice is in the neighborhood, no fabricated claims, stakeholder-ready structure. Anticipate these checks — front-load honest assessment of weak sections in your Confidence Assessment.

### Step 7: Create Output Document

Create the output document as a new file:

1. Determine the output path: `Output/{idea-name}-{output-format}.md`
   - Example: `Output/ai-as-cognitive-liberation-in-edtech-strategy-doc.md`
   - Create the `Output/` directory if it does not exist
2. Write the drafted document to this file with appropriate frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: incubator/output
source-idea: Ideas/{idea-name}.md
output-format: strategy-doc | product-brief
stage: drafting
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

3. The body is the complete first draft following the output template.
4. Append the Known Gaps section at the bottom:

```markdown
---

## Known Gaps

| Section | Gap | What Would Fill It | Severity |
|---------|-----|-------------------|----------|
| [Section name] | [What's missing] | [Research, human input, stakeholder conversation, etc.] | Blocker / Advisory |
```

### Step 8: Update Idea Card

Update the idea card frontmatter ONLY — do not modify the idea card body (the TL;DR content stays):

- `stage: drafting`
- `updated: {today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format}` — use `Bash(date:*)` to get today's date
- `output-file: Output/{idea-name}-{output-format}.md`

**Do NOT modify the idea card body.** The TL;DR content is the permanent scannable artifact.

### Step 9: Present for Review

Present the completed draft with:

**Draft Summary:**
- Output format used (strategy doc or product brief)
- Total sections drafted
- Sections with full source coverage vs. sections with gaps

**Confidence Assessment:**

| Section | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| [Section name] | High / Medium / Low | [Why — sourced vs. synthesized vs. flagged] |

High = section is well-sourced from TL;DR + research + strategy docs
Medium = section synthesizes across sources but has minor gaps
Low = section relies heavily on synthesis or has "[NEEDS INPUT]" markers

**Known Gaps:**
- Summary of "[NEEDS INPUT]" markers and what would resolve them
- Which gaps are blockers vs. advisory

**Recommended Refinement Priorities:**
- Which sections should get human attention first (ordered by impact on document quality)
- What additional research or context would most improve the draft

**Output Document:**
- Location: `Output/{idea-name}-{output-format}.md`
- Idea card unchanged — TL;DR persists as scannable portfolio entry

## Stop Rules

At any point during execution, stop and report when:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `stage` is not `developing` | Stop. Report current stage. This skill only drafts developing-stage ideas. |
| `output-format` is null | Stop. Human must decide: strategy-doc or product-brief. |
| TL;DR template is incomplete (any of: core insight, problem, who cares, strategic connection missing) | Stop. Report which fields are missing. Idea needs further development before drafting. |
| Impact dimensions are unrated (any of the five dimensions are null) | Stop. Report which dimensions are null. Idea needs further development. |
| No research artifacts exist (`research:` array is empty or referenced files have no substantive content) | Stop. Report: no research available. Idea needs development research before drafting. |
| Foundation Assessment is "Weak" | Stop. Research concluded the idea lacks strategic foundation. Report what was found. |
| Critical gap threshold exceeded (>30% of required template sections have no source material) | Stop. List unsourced sections and what input would fill each. Do not draft a hollow document. |
| Critical context can only come from human | Stop. Report what's missing and why it cannot be researched. Ask the human to provide. |

When stopping, state explicitly:
1. What was checked
2. What failed
3. What specific action would unblock (be precise — "add research on X" not "do more research")

## Error Handling Summary

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| No argument and no developing-stage ideas exist | Report "No developing-stage ideas found in Ideas/" and exit |
| Idea file not found | Report with available filenames from Ideas/ listing, exit |
| Idea not at developing stage | Report current stage, exit |
| output-format is null | Report: human must set output-format before drafting, exit |
| Missing required frontmatter fields (impact dimensions null) | Report specific missing fields, exit |
| TL;DR body sections incomplete | Report specific missing sections, exit |
| Research artifacts referenced but files not found | Report which files are missing, continue with available sources if above threshold |
| Research artifacts empty or no substantive content | Report: insufficient research for drafting, exit |
| Foundation Assessment is "Weak" | Report: idea lacks strategic foundation per research, exit |
| Strategy doc Grep returns no results | Note "No matches found in {doc}" as a finding, continue with available sources |
| Web search returns no relevant results | Note "No relevant results for {query}", continue with available sources |
| Approach methodology file not found | Report: incubator-approach.md missing, exit — methodology is required for drafting |
| Output template file not found | Report: template file missing, exit — template structure is required for drafting |
| >30% sections unsourced after sufficiency mapping | Report gap list with fill recommendations, exit |
| Idea file has malformed frontmatter | Report parsing issue with specifics, exit |
| Output document write fails | Report error — the output document must be created before updating idea card frontmatter |

## Scope Boundaries

This skill does NOT:
- Create seed files (that is the router's job via `/process-inbox`)
- Develop seeds into TL;DR nuggets (that is the `/develop` skill, Stage 1->2)
- Decide output format — strategy doc vs. product brief (that is a human decision; `output-format` must be set before invocation)
- Refine the draft (that is Stage 4, driven by human + agent collaboration)
- Approve the final document (that is Stage 5, human approval required)
- Process inbox items (that is `/process-inbox`)
- Merge or consolidate ideas autonomously
- Load full strategy docs into context (Grep only — paths configured in CLAUDE.md under Configuration > External References)
- Invoke Gemini CLI
- Create TL;DR snapshots — the idea card body is not replaced, so no snapshot is needed
- Modify `incubator-backlog.json` or `incubator-progress.md` — those are session orchestration files
- Modify the idea card body — the TL;DR is the permanent scannable artifact. /draft only updates idea card frontmatter (stage, output-file).
- Proceed past first draft — presents for human review and stops. Never proceed from Stage 3->4 without human review.

## Voice Requirements

All written output in the idea file must follow these standards (from `persona.md`):

- **Confident and declarative.** "The real opportunity is..." not "A potential opportunity might be..."
- **Multiplicative framing.** Show how one move unlocks value across multiple dimensions simultaneously.
- **Concrete and specific.** Names, numbers, examples — not abstractions.
- **Business-outcome language.** Retention, engagement, revenue, competitive positioning — not design methodology.
- **No hedging.** Say it or don't. Cut "could potentially" and "might consider."
- **Natural flow.** Direct, not verbose.
- **Template intent over template mechanics.** Embody the template's intent, don't mechanically fill sections.

**Anti-patterns to kill:** "leverage," "synergies," "holistic," "robust," "proven," "utilize," passive voice, conditional hedging ("could potentially," "might consider," "it may be worth exploring").
