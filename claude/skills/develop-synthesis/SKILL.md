# /develop-synthesis — Strategic Synthesis Step

Transforms a seed-stage idea and its research handoff into a completed TL;DR card. This is the judgment-heavy step of the /develop pipeline — the agent carries the strategic reasoning framework.

Normally invoked by the /develop orchestrator after research (Steps 0-4) is complete. Can also be invoked directly for testing or re-synthesis.

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to resolve the target idea file.

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Empty | Report error: idea name required. Exit. |
| `idea-name` | Resolve to `Ideas/{idea-name}.md` |
| `idea-name.md` | Strip `.md`, resolve as above |

If exact match fails, try fuzzy substring match against filenames in `Ideas/`. One match: use it. Multiple: list and exit. Zero: report and exit.

## Execution

### Step 1: Load Context

Load in parallel:

1. **Seed file** — `Ideas/{idea-name}.md` (full content)
2. **Research handoff** — `Research/{idea-name}/synthesis-handoff.md`
   - If not found: report "No research handoff found at Research/{idea-name}/synthesis-handoff.md — run /develop research phase first or create manually for testing." Exit.
3. **Persona guide** — `persona.md`
4. **Format example** — `Examples/developing-card.md`
5. **Related ideas** — Read the `related-ideas` array from the seed's frontmatter. For each entry, read `Ideas/{related-idea}.md` up to the first `###` heading or 30 lines — enough to get frontmatter and header fields (Core insight, Problem, Who cares, Strategic connection). If the handoff includes a Portfolio Context section, use that instead of reading files.

### Step 2: Validate

Confirm:
- Seed file exists and has `stage: seed` in frontmatter
- Research handoff exists and is non-empty
- Persona guide loads successfully

If seed is not at `stage: seed`: report current stage and exit. The orchestrator is responsible for validating stage before invocation; this is a safety check.

### Step 3: Synthesize

Apply the reasoning dimensions from the agent definition (The User's Moment, The Single Strategic Move, The Compound, The Strategic Connection, The Unique Territory) to produce the TL;DR card content. The agent definition carries the full reasoning framework, rubrics, voice requirements, and output template.

Write the completed card to the idea file:
- Update frontmatter (stage, updated date, impact dimensions)
- Replace body content above `### Original Capture` with the TL;DR template
- Preserve `### Original Capture`

### Step 4: Report

Present what was produced:

```
Synthesis complete: {idea-name}

Impact dimensions: {CS}/{UX}/{RP}/{ID}/{SA}
Card written to: Ideas/{idea-name}.md
```

## Error Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| No argument provided | Report: idea name required. Exit. |
| Idea file not found | Fuzzy match, report available files. Exit. |
| Research handoff not found | Report: run research phase first. Exit. |
| Seed not at seed stage | Report current stage. Exit. |
| Persona guide not found | Report: missing persona guide. Exit. |
